# FirePython

FirePython is a sexy Python logger console integrated into [Firebug][firebug]. 

Originally, I have created it to light up my lonely nights I was spending with [Google App Engine][appengine].

## Prerequisites

You definitely need [Firebug 1.2 or higher][firebug].

## Installation

### Firefox Addon
Preferred way is to install this firefox extension via addons.mozilla.com.
The latest version is [available here][firepython].

Warning: some people have reported they are unable to download and install extension from addons.mozilla.com. 
In this case you may [try workaround][workaround].

Here is [source repository for firefox addon][addon-homepage] with instructions how to install bleeding edge version.

### Python Library

#### The easy way

``sudo easy_install firepython``

#### The manual way

Just note, that it depends on simplejson.

Clone [project from github][homepage] in your project directory.

Or if your web project uses git for versioning, you may want to be cool and use firepython as a submodule of your git repository.
  
``git submodule add git://github.com/darwin/firepython.git firepython``

(you may want to replace last parameter with real path in your repo)

If firepython directory is not on your import paths, you need to add ``firepython`` folder into your ``sys.path``.

## Usage

### Django

After installation, enable middleware by adding its path in ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES``: ``firepython.middleware.FirePythonDjango``. 

### WSGI compatible

After installation, enable middleware ``firepython.middleware.FirePythonWSGI``.

### Custom usage

Look for inspiration in [middleware.py][middleware-source]

## Real world examples

  * [FirePython added to Bloog][bloog-example] (blog engine for GAE)
  * [FirePython added to DryDrop][drydrop-example] (GAE hosting engine for GitHubbers && !Pythonists)

# Current State

Version 0.2 is tested to work with alpha Firebug 1.3 and Firefox 3.1.

Version 0.3 will also work with final Firebug 1.3 + Firefox 3.1 and Firebug 1.2.1 + Firefox 3.0.4.
